The bottom leg may be bent with the foot outside the opposite hip or extended with toes vertically. The arms help leverage the torso into the twist and may be bound (Baddha Ardha Matsyendrasana) in a number of configurations by clutching either feet or opposite hands."/></a>

In his Light on Yoga, B. K. S. Iyengar uses a forearm support, with the fingers interlocked around the head, for the basic posture Sirsasana I and its variations; he demonstrates a Western-style tripod headstand, the palms of the hands on the ground with raised elbows, for Sirsasana II and III; and other supports for further variants. Iyengar names and illustrates ten variants in all, as well as several preparatory and transitional poses.

	The yoga headstand is nicknamed "king" of all the asanas.A variety of other asanas can be used to build the upper body strength and balance required for Sirsasana."/></a>

The asana sequence was first recorded as yoga in the early 20th century, though similar exercises were in use in India before that, for example among wrestlers. The basic sequence involves moving from a standing position into Downward and Upward Dog poses and then back to the standing position, but many variations are possible. The set of 12 asanas is dedicated to the Hindu God Surya. In some Indian traditions, the positions are each associated with a different mantra.

	Variant sequences called Chandra Namaskar (Moon Salutation) have also been created."/></a>

The arm on the lower leg side is raised, the forearm bent down, while the other arm reaches down behind the back, the forearm bent up, so the hands can clasp between the shoulder blades.[6]

	The sitting position can be modified either by putting a folded blanket on the heels, and if need be also one beneath them.[6]

	The pose stretches the shoulders. The hand position can be modified using a strap to extend the reach for those who cannot bring the hands together behind the back. The pose is contra-indicated for people with a rotator cuff injury."/></a>
