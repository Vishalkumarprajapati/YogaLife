<center>38 Ways Yoga Improves Health</center><br><br>
<center><u><font size="6" 
<font size="5" color="black"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1). Improves your flexibility
Improved flexibility is one of the first and most obvious benefits of yoga. During your first class, you probably won't be able to touch your toes, never mind do a backbend. But if you stick with it, you'll notice a gradual loosening, and eventually, seemingly impossible poses will become possible. You'll also probably notice that aches and pains start to disappear. That's no coincidence. Tight hips can strain the knee joint due to improper alignment of the thigh and shinbones. Tight hamstrings can lead to a flattening of the lumbar spine, which can cause back pain. And inflexibility in muscles and connective tissue, such as fascia and ligaments, can cause poor posture.
<br><br><br>
2). Builds muscle strength
Strong muscles do more than look good. They also protect us from conditions like arthritis and back pain, and help prevent falls in elderly people. And when you build strength through yoga, you balance it with flexibility. If you just went to the gym and lifted weights, you might build strength at the expense of flexibility.

<u><center><font size="6" <font size="5"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3).Perfects your posture
Your head is like a bowling ball—big, round, and heavy. When it's balanced directly over an erect spine, it takes much less work for your neck and back muscles to support it. Move it several inches forward, however, and you start to strain those muscles. Hold up that forward-leaning bowling ball for eight or 12 hours a day and it's no wonder you're tired. And fatigue might not be your only problem. Poor posture can cause back, neck, and other muscle and joint problems. As you slump, your body may compensate by flattening the normal inward curves in your neck and lower back. This can cause pain and degenerative arthritis of the spine.

In this, you have to focus more on 7 out of 9 subjects. Because merit is made from 7 subject papers!

<align="left"><font size="6" color="blue"><b># How To Choose Optional Subjects</b><br></center></font>
<u><center><b><font size="6" color="blue">Importance of Objective Subjects</u></center></b></font><br>
<font size="5"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some points to define the Imortance of Objective subjects..............<br>
1. It is not completely correct to say that general studies is of 1000 marks and optional subject is only 500 marks, so candidates should give more emphasis on general studies. Such sayers probably do not understand the strategic importance of the optional subject. In this exam, it does not matter exactly how many marks a candidate has scored. The importance is only on how few or more points a candidate has scored compared to other competitors.<br>
2. If you look at the exam results of the last few years, you will find that almost all the serious candidates of Hindi medium got 325-350 marks in General Studies (Nishant Jain scored 378 marks in the 2014 Civil Services Examination as an exception. Were). In contrast, English medium serious candidates scored 20–30 marks on average, while almost all serious candidates in the elective subject scored 270–325. With this average, the importance of the optional subject itself becomes clear. Keep in mind that you can get these benefits only if you have chosen the optional subject very carefully.<br>
<font color="white" size="5">Candidates should choose the objective subject which is the subject of their graduation. We suggest to you that , "choose that subject in which your fully interest".</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of candidates selected in the Civil Services Main Examination is 2.5 times the number of seats advertised. That is, 2500 out of about 15000 are selected for interview. This is the most difficult phase of civil service and if the selection is done here then the chances of final selection are increased a lot.<br><br></font></i>
<u><center><font size="6" color="blue"> <b>Personality Test (INTERVIEW)</center></u></b></font><br>
<font size="5"><i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interview is the second part of the Civil Services Main Examination! This is called a personality test! This interview is of a total of 275 marks. It is also known as IAS interview in common language. Its syllabus is not fixed and most questions are asked from your Detail Application Form (DAF)! Therefore DAF should be filled with full caution and complete truth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the IAS interview, the candidate has to come to the Dholpur House Building of UPSC in Delhi. Here, all the original documents of the candidates are verified and put in a common hall. An interview panel is made under the chairmanship of the members of the UPSC, who interview the candidates. In the interview panel, veterans from different regions of the country are invited.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In IAS Interview, the confidence, attitude and problem solving skills of the candidate are checked. Here the subjective assessment of the personality of the candidate is done and out of a maximum of 275 marks, marks are given<br></font></i>
<font color="white" size="5">
Even after failing in IAS interview, the government is considering it.</font><br><br></i>
<u><font size="5" color="blue"><center><b>Learn the interview experiences of IAS Toppers</font></center></b></u><br>
<font size="5"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil service interviews last about 20 days and the final result comes only after 10 days of the end of the interview. Final Merit List Interview and Civil Services Main Examination consist of written marks. This means that out of a maximum of 2025 marks, a final merit list is made, on the basis of which services are provided. Candidates up to 100 ranks get IAS service.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days after the result, the UPSC sends its recommendations to the Ministry of Personnel, after which appointment letters are issued to everyone. Those candidates who do not make it to the final result have to go through the whole process again<br><br>
